# Behavior Cloning:

This repository hosts the codebase running the car in Udacity simulator. A CNN model is trained to steer the car. This model uses images from the camera to calculate steering angle. All the dependencies are included in 'BehaviorCloning.yml' file.

## Running the Simulator:
$ conda env create -f BehaviorCloning.yml  
$ conda activate BehaviorCloning  
$ python drive.py  

Open the Udacity simulator with 800x600 Screen ration and Graphics quality 'Fastest'. Start the simulator in autonomous mode.
